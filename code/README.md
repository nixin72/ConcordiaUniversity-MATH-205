## Reimann Sum calculator
Really just a quick command line utility to calculate Reimann sums. 
```
$ reimann 4x^2+4x+2 1 3 right
86
$ reimann 4x^2+4x+2 1 3 left
158
```

Can download by running 
```
git clone https://github.com/phdumaresq/calculus.git
cp ./calculus/reimann /usr/bin/
```

Might add more utilities to it if need be, just made this because I forgot a calculator at home.
